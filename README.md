VCD Compare v1.5.0

DESCRIPTION
  Command line arguments influence the type of input accepted and certain default parameters.
  The program reads and writes to the current directory. It expects every .out and .log file within 
  the current directory to be a Gaussian VCD output file containing information about one of the 
  conformations of a single compound. It also expects experimental data to be within the current 
  directory. The default temperature is 300 K and the default range of interest is 1000-1500 cm^-1. 
  The program will optimize the scale factory and the peak width of the theoretical data to best fit 
  the experimental spectrum.
